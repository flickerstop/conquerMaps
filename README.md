# Conquer Maps
 Here's a collection of some custom created or edited maps using my personal mapping tool. Any of the maps that are posted here are free to use, I just have a couple personal requests if you use them:
 1. Don't claim you created it yourself.
 2. Do not remove/replace `data/map/mapobj/customMaps/custom/zcookie.dds`. There's a cookie hidden on every map as a sort of "signature" and a game to find them.
 3. Just some type of acknowledgement the map was created by "Cookie" when you patch it in.

 If you end up using these maps I would love to see what you're using them for! Add me on discord `𝒞𝑜𝑜𝓀𝒾𝑒🍪#4026 (981244429643956255)`. I'll probably end up making a discord so people can ask questions/requests or showcase how they're using the maps. (If the link isn't here I haven't made it yet)


## How to Install
 You can simply drop the map files (except `README.md`) from the map folder into the client. You need to [edit the `GameMap.dat`](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/co2-pserver-guides-releases/1779161-release-gamemap-editor-complete.html) to access them on your server.

 Each map's readme will have the exact data required for `MiniMap.ani` to add the minimap correctly, just be sure to replace the `xxxx` with your map's Id from `GameMap.dat`!


## Notes
 Each map will have a `README.md` that will explain the map a bit more in detail but most should be pretty straight forward. I'll also try to post important coordinates if they're needed.

# Special Thanks
 I would like to thank `Nyorai` for initially helping me understand the basics to the Conquer mapping system and pushing me to start this project. And an even bigger thanks to `CptSky` for his wizardry 🧙🏿‍♂️, I would have never been able to test these maps without the magical tools he's created and the help he's provided to understand the deeper mapping system.

 No I will not be releasing my map editor/creator at this time.
